> Customizable date _(and time)_ picker. Opt-in UI, no jQuery!

Rome wasn't built in a day. Browser support includes every sane browser and **IE7+**.

#### Demo!

You can [see a live demo here][3].

[![screenshot.png][4]][3]

Oh, `rome` synchronizes in real-time with inputs, never steals focus, and its CSS is entirely customizable!

<sub>Rome depends on [`moment`][6]. It doesn't depend on jQuery or other weird frameworks, though.

## Install

From npm or Bower.

```shell
npm install --save rome
```

```shell
bower install --save rome
```

Note that if you're using the standalone version, the API is published under the `rome` global. If you're using CJS, then you'll have to `require('rome')`.

### Setup

You can use your own distribution of [`moment`][6], using `rome.standalone.js`.

```html
<script src='moment.js'></script>
<script src='rome.standalone.js'></script>
```

You could just use the bundled `rome.js` distribution, which comes with [`moment`][6] in it.

```html
<script src='rome.js'></script>
```

If you need to do anything regarding internationalization, [refer to `moment` for that][5]. Ideally, make those changes before starting to create Rome calendar components.

## API

The API in `rome` exposes a few properties.

### `rome.find(elem)`

If a calendar is associated to the provided `elem`, then that calendar is returned, otherwise returns `null`. DOM elements can only have one associated calendar.

### `rome(elem, options={})`

This method creates a calendar instance and associates it to the provided `elem`. This association can't be undone even by `.destroy()`ing the `rome` instance, because it can be `.restore()`d later. Subsequent calls to `rome(elem)` will return the associated calendar, instead of creating a new one _<sub>(see `rome.find(elem)`)</sub>_. Think of this as a _"caching feature"_.

Creating a calendar has a ton of options. These have reasonable defaults that are easy to adjust, too. The options are listed below.

Option             | Description
-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`appendTo`         | DOM element where the calendar will be appended to. Takes `'parent'` as the parent element
`autoClose`        | When set to `true`, the calendar is auto-closed when picking a day _(or a time if `time: true` and `date: false`). A value of `'time'` will only auto-close the calendar when a time is picked.
`autoHideOnBlur`   | Hides the calendar when focusing something other than the input field
`autoHideOnClick`  | Hides the calendar when clicking away
`date`             | The calendar shows days and allows you to navigate between months
`dateValidator`    | Function to validate that a given date is considered valid. Receives a native `Date` parameter.
`dayFormat`        | Format string used to display days on the calendar
`initialValue`     | Value used to initialize calendar. Takes `string`, `Date`, or `moment`
`inputFormat`      | Format string used for the input field as well as the results of `rome`
`invalidate`       | Ensures the date is valid when the field is blurred
`strictParse`      | Compares input strictly against `inputFormat`, and partial matches are discarded
`max`              | Disallow dates past `max`. Takes `string`, `Date`, or `moment`
`min`              | Disallow dates before `min`. Takes `string`, `Date`, or `moment`
`monthFormat`      | Format string used by the calendar to display months and their year
`monthsInCalendar` | How many months get rendered in the calendar
`required`         | Is the field required or do you allow empty values?
`styles`           | CSS classes applied to elements on the calendar
`time`             | The calendar shows the current time and allows you to change it using a dropdown
`timeFormat`       | Format string used to display the time on the calendar
`timeInterval`     | Seconds between each option in the time dropdown
`timeValidator`    | Function to validate that a given time is considered valid. Receives a native `Date` parameter.
`weekdayFormat`    | Format used to display weekdays. Takes `min` _(Mo)_, `short` _(Mon)_, `long` _(Monday)_, or an array with seven strings of your choosing.
`weekStart`        | Day considered the first of the week. Range: Sunday `0` - Saturday `6`

Note that in the case of input fields, when `initialValue` isn't provided the initial value is inferred from `elem.value` instead. In the case of inline calendars, `new Date()` will be used as a default if none is provided.

#### Inlining the Calendar

If you pass in an element other than an input tag, then this method behaves slightly differently. The difference is that `appendTo` becomes the provided `elem`, and the calendar won't attach itself to an input element. The options listed below will be ignored.

- `autoHideOnBlur`, because there is no input field that can be tracked for `blur` events
- `invalidate`, because there is no input field to keep consistent with the calendar component
- `required`, because you can easily do that on an input field
- `styles.positioned`, because the calendar will be considered inlined

All of the other options still apply, and identical behavior should be expected.

#### Default Options

If you don't set an option, the default will be used. You can [look up the defaults here][1], or below.

```json

  "appendTo": document.body,
  "autoClose": true,

#### Rome API

When you create a calendar with `rome(elem)`, you'll get a `cal` instance back. This has a few API methods. Most of these methods return the calendar instance whenever possible, allowing for method chaining.

##### `.show()`

Shows the calendar. If associated with an input, the calendar gets absolutely position right below the input field.

##### `.hide()`

Hides the calendar.

##### `.id`

Auto-generated unique identifier assigned to this instance of Rome.

##### `.container`

The DOM element that contains the calendar.

##### `.associated`

The associated DOM element assigned to this calendar instance. This is the input field or parent element that you used to create the calendar.

##### `.getDate()`

Returns the current date, as defined by the calendar, in a native `Date` object. If `required: false` you'll get `null` when the input field is empty.

##### `.getDateString(format?)`

Returns the current date, as defined by the calendar, using the provided `options.inputFormat` format string or a format of your choosing. If `required: false` you'll get `null` when the input field is empty.

##### `.getMoment()`

Returns a copy of the `moment` object underlying the current date in the calendar. If `required: false` you'll get `null` when the input field is empty.

##### `.destroy()`

Removes the calendar from the DOM and all of its associated DOM event listeners. The only responsive API method becomes the `.restore` method described below, the rest of the API becomes no-op methods. After emitting the `destroyed` event, all event listeners are removed from the instance.

##### `.destroyed`

Returns `true` when the calendar is in a destroyed state and `false` otherwise.

##### `.restore(options?)`

Restores the calendar, using the provided options (or the default options). The associated DOM element can't be changed. The API methods are restored to their original functionality.

##### `.options(options?)`

If an options object is provided, it destroys the calendar and initializes it with the provided options. Effectively the same as calling `.restore(options)` immediately after calling `.destroy()`.

If no options object is provided, a copy of the current options is returned.

##### `.options.reset()`

Resets the options to the factory defaults. Effectively the same as calling `.options({})` while preserving the `appendTo` option.

##### `.emitValues()`

Emits all of the data events listed below. Mostly used internally, **should be avoided** in consumer-land.

##### `.setValue(value)`

Sets the current date to the provided `value`, but only if that value is valid according to the rules defined by the calendar. Takes `string`, `Date`, or `moment`. Mostly used internally, and it doesn't emit any events.

##### `.refresh()`

Forces a refresh of the calendar. This method will redraw the month and update the dates that can be selected in accordance with `dateValidator` and `timeValidator`.

##### `.back()`

Steps the calendar display back by one month. Equivalent to clicking the 'back' button.
Returns `undefined`.

##### `.next()`

Steps the calendar display forward by one month. Equivalent to clicking the 'next' button.
Returns `undefined`.

#### Events

Rome calendars also provide a few events you can subscribe to. These events are published through an event emitter created using [`contra`][2]. These events are listed below.

Event       | Arguments   | Description
------------|-------------|------------
`ready`     | `[options]` | The calendar has been `.restore`d
`destroyed` | `[]`        | The calendar has been `.destroy`ed
`data`      | `[value]`   | The date may have been updated by the calendar. Value of `.getDateString()` is provided
`year`      | `[year]`    | The year may have been updated by the calendar. Value of `moment.year()` is provided
`month`     | `[month]`   | The month may have been updated by the calendar. Value of `moment.month()` is provided
`day`       | `[day]`     | The day may have been updated by the calendar. Value of `moment.date()` is provided
`time`      | `[time]`    | The time may have been updated by the calendar. Formatted time string is provided
`show`      | `[]`        | The calendar has been displayed
`hide`      | `[]`        | The calendar has been hidden
`back`      | `[month]`   | The calendar view has been moved back a month to the value `moment.month()`
`next`      | `[month]`   | The calendar view has been moved forward a month to the value `moment.month()`

#### Date and Time Validator

Please note that `dateValidator` and `timeValidator` both receive a native `Date` object as a parameter. These methods are expected to return `undefined` or `true` if the date is deemed valid, and `false` in case the date is invalid. If `dateValidator` returns `false`, the validation process will try to find a valid date near the desired date.

If `dateValidator` passes for a given date, the `timeValidator` will attempt to validate that date as well. If the time is invalid, the day will be probed for a valid time. This validation starts at the desired time, and grows in `timeInterval` increments. When the end of the day is reached, validation resumes at the start of the day instead of leaping to the next day.

### `rome.val`

There are a few default validator factories provided by Rome to make your life easier.

These methods take a `moment`, a `Date`, a `string` that can be parsed into a `moment` using `inputFormat`, or a DOM element that Rome could use to look up another Rome instance.

If you passed in a DOM element, the validator will look up the associated Rome instance and validate using its value. The first time the validator is executed on any inline calendar, the `'data'` event for that calendar will be hooked to refresh the related calendar.

For usage examples you can [refer to the demos][3].

#### `rome.val.afterEq(value)`

Returns whether the date is after the provided value. The comparison uses `>=`, meaning it's inclusive.

#### `rome.val.after(value)`

Returns whether the date is after the provided value. The comparison uses `>`, meaning it's exclusive.

#### `rome.val.beforeEq(value)`

Returns whether the date is before the provided value. The comparison uses `<=`, meaning it's inclusive.

#### `rome.val.before(value)`

Returns whether the date is before the provided value. The comparison uses `<`, meaning it's exclusive.

#### `rome.val.except(left, right)`

Returns whether the date is any date except the provided value. You can provide a wide variety of input values. Keep in mind `Date`, `string`, `moment`, and the DOM element used to find another calendar are all valid input types.

##### Providing `left` only means **"any date except this one"**

If you use `rome.val.except('2014-08-09')`, then `'2014-08-09'` is invalid.

##### Providing `left` and `right` means **"any date that's not in this range"**

If you use `rome.val.except('2014-08-09', '2014-09-01')`, then anything between `'2014-08-09'` and `'2014-09-01'` is invalid.

##### If `left` is an array, each element in the array is treated as the simple case described above

In this case, `right` is completely ignored. Every item in the array is treated as follows.

###### If the item is single, then a rule is built on that single date

Using `rome.val.except(['2014-08-09', '2014-09-01'])` means that `'2014-08-09'` and `'2014-09-01'` are both invalid dates.

###### If the item is an array, the first two items are used to determine a date range

Using `rome.val.except([['2014-08-09', '2014-09-01']])` means anything between `'2014-08-09'` and `'2014-09-01'` is invalid.

These two types of entries can be combined in any way you like. Each entry will exclude additional dates.

For instance, `[['2014-04-05', '2014-04-15'], ['2014-04-25', '2014-04-30'], '2014-05-05']` means that April 05 to 15, and April 25 to 30, along with May 05 are all invalid dates.

#### `rome.val.only(left, right)`

Identical behavior to `rome.val.except`, except for the fact that the selected dates become **the only valid dates**, rather than the **only invalid dates**.

### `rome.moment`

Exposes the [`moment`][6] instance used by Rome. To change the `moment` instance, refer to `rome.use(moment)`.

### `rome.use(moment)`

Sets the instance of `moment` used by Rome.
